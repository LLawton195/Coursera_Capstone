    "A local business owner is looking to open a new bar in the city of Leeds, the issue is that they are unsure on a specific location in which to open. They also do not know exactly what type of bar to open (e.g. simply a bar, speakeasy, traditional pub, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "They wish to open as soon as possible and have spoken to several stakeholders concerning this task. A stakeholder has suggested using location data to decide upon a suitable location to open the bar. As such, they have reached out to a Data Scientist in order to complete this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leveraging the Foursquare location data API, this report will endeavour to highlight potential areas where it may be profitable to open a bar. It may be the case that a location with few bars surrounding it may be the best fit, however more factors are to be considered. For example, many people do not stay in one bar for an entire night out and as such it may be more profitable to open a bar in a busier area in order to increase foot traffic and subsequent profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "It completely depends on the type of establishment that is to be opened, so this report will attempt to answer this question. A __clustering approach__ will be taken to segment the different areas around Leeds in order to locate an optimal location to open this business."

    "### Location of bars\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this analysis looked at the number of bars/pubs located within Leeds, leveraging the Foursquare Places API. This detailed a total number of __98__ unique venues located within 1 km of the centre point of each Leeds postcode. Displayed on a map; it was apparent that the majority of these venues were located closer to Leeds City Centre, specifically postcodes LS1, LS2 and LS3.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is to be expected, as a developed city such as Leeds has a large number of people frequenting bars towards its centre. Higher foot-traffic by customers of course means a higher potential for earnings, assuming the bar is popular. The downsides to a more central location include higher rent payments and more competition with other established premises. Care should be taken if choosing to establish a bar towards the centre of Leeds and market research should be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "__K-Means clustering__ was utilised for this report, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It was able to effectively cluster the different areas around Leeds based upon the types of venues found within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the clustering analysis, we can view that the clusters labelled 0, 3 and 4 contained few instances of bars/pubs, owing to the fact they clustered differently from clusters 1, 2 and 5. Clusters 0, 3 and 4 also contained only one postcode in their cluster - potentially highlighting that starting up a bar in these areas would not be profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Specifically...__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cluster 0 featured one instance of a pub in the top ten venues, but most other venues included landmarks, sports clubs and train stations.\n",
    "* Cluster 3 was similar, featuring mostly sports clubs, restaurants and some types of shops.\n",
    "* Cluster 4 contained one postcode (LS10), containing more restaurants and shops as well as a stadium. Geographically, this is just south of the centre of Leeds and near to the Elland Road stadium - home of Leeds United Football Club.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Clusters 1, 2 & 5__\n",
    "\n",
    "Clusters 1, 2 and 5 contained the most number of postcodes compared to the others. The majority of these feature some form of pub/bar as the most popular venue within that postcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 2 contains most of the postcodes that are considered \"central Leeds\", which coincides with our findings from plotting the locations of bars on the map of Leeds. Cluster 1 features many of the postcodes that contain a high number of bars, also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 5 includes some central locations, as well as capturing many establishments which are located along the outskirts of the main city and containing rural villages. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting observation within these clusters is that bars are much more common the closer to the city centre the postcodes are. This may be owed to the fact that people tend to visit more than one location when they go into the city to have some drinks. Postcodes which surround the more central locations tend to be to be pubs, which are traditionally more homely and people spend longer there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all clusters created, there are no instances of a speakeasy appearing in the top ten most common venues for any postcode. This may highlight a gap in the market for a more laid-back venue to open within the city of Leeds or its outskirts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where would be suitable?\n",
    "\n",
    "The above analysis has helped to elucidate an appropriate location to open a new bar within the city of Leeds. The entire area, including every postcode, has been included in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would recommend that the business owner consider setting up their new venture in any of the postcodes outlined in clusters __1, 2 or 5__. It may be pertinent to consider opening a bar if a more central location is considered, whereas a pub may be much more suitable for a more rural location. Depending on the decision, appropriate market research of these areas combined with this clustering analysis should further highlight an optimal position in which to open a new business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, this analysis has highlighted that there are few speakeasies located within the city of Leeds, so this may be a profitable venture if the business owner is looking to open a venue which is less common."
